    <ol>
      <li><b>Winter Rules</b> - Only within their own fairway shall a player be allowed to lift their ball out of a divot, out of a rough patch or off of bare ground. They may also lift the ball to clean it. The player must then drop their ball according to standard USGA ball dropping rules.</li>
      <li><b>Out of Bounds</b> - If a ball is hit out of bounds, the player may drop his ball two club-lengths from the point where the ball crossed the out of bounds line, but no closer to the hole.  The original stroke is counted and a <i>one stroke penalty</i> is applied.  <b>Note:</b>  This rule applies to par threes as well.</li>
      <li><b>Water Hazard</b> - (<font color="Yellow">Yellow</font> Stakes) You may play the ball as it lies or, <i>under penalty of one stroke,</i> drop any distance behind the water hazard (keeping the point at which the original ball last crossed the
  margin of the water hazard directly between the hole and the spot on which the ball is dropped), or replay the shot.</li>
      <li><b>Lateral Water Hazard</b> - (<font color="Red">Red</font> Stakes) You may play the ball as it lies or, you may also, <i>under penalty of one stroke,</i> drop within two club-lengths of (a) the point where the ball last crossed the hazard margin or (b)
    a point on the opposite hazard margin equidistant from the hole.</li>
      <li><b>Unplayable Lies</b> - Players have three options for unplayable lies: (a) two club-lengths from where the ball lies, (b) any distance behind keeping the line to the flag, (c) or hitting from the original spot - <i>all under the penalty of one stroke.</i></li>
      <li><b>Lost Ball </b> - Players have three options for playing a lost ball: (a) two club-lengths from where you think the ball was lost, (b) any distance behind keeping the line to the flag, or (c) hitting from the original spot - <i>all under the penalty of one stroke.</i></li>
      <li><b>Drop Areas</b> - As of 2009, Emerald Greens removed the drop location for Silver #6 and Bronze #5. To keep league play mellifluous (flowing smoothly), the West Blue Golf League will use a league drop area on the near, right hand corner, proceeding
    the green. (Or in other words, where the drop location was in previous years or should have been if there wasn't one. Use common sense.)</li>
      <li><b>Opponent Doesn't show</b> - If a player does not have an opponent, then the scoring will go as follows. The player automatically gets 6 points for winning the match. The player will then play against his handicap on a per hole basis. For example,
    if a player has a handicap of 9, he would get one stroke on each hole. Par or less would be worth 2 points. One over par would be worth 1 point. If a player does not have an opponent, then the maximum score possible on a hole is par plus 4. This rule
    applies only for when a player does not have an opponent!</li>
      <li><b>Late Arrival</b> - If a player shows up late, then his opponent would score the missed holes as described in <b>Opponent Doesn't show</b>. The missing player would also lose all of the 6 match points. For example, if a player arrives late and catches
    up with his team on the third hole, then he will receive 0 points for holes one and two and lose the 6 match points. His opponent will then receive however many points won playing against his own handicap for holes one and two, and the 6 match points.
    Lastly, the missed holes for the player who shows up late should be calculated against their handicap. For example let's say they are an 8 handicap, missed the first two holes with hole #1 being a par 4 and the toughest hole, and hole #2 being a par
    4 and the easiest hole. The late player would then receive a score of 5 on hole #1 (because they get one stroke on this hole) and a 4 on hole #2. NOTE: They don't score points, we simply do this to calculate their full score for handicaps.</li>
      <li><b>Subs</b> - All dues paying league players are allowed to sub for any other team within the league. Unless waved by the scheduled golfer, it's expected the substitution golfer compensates the originally scheduled player. Teams are allowed to fill their
    open tee-time with players from outside the league. The outside player <b>will not</b> be allowed to compete for points.</li>
      <li><b>Playoff Ties</b> - If a playoff round ends in a tie, a one-hole playoff, starting on the first hole of the respective course, will be played by all matches. That is, Team A's #1 will play Team B's #1, Team A's #2 will play Team B's #2, etc. If a tie
    exists after the first hole, all match-ups will continue to the second hole. Handicaps apply just as they always do.</li>
      <li><b>End-of-year Regular Season Ties</b> - If two teams tie at the end of the regular season, the following tiebreaker rules shall be followed for playoff placement. <b>1st tiebreaker:</b> head to head. <b>2nd tiebreaker:</b> Most points scored during head
    to head. <b>3rd tiebreaker:</b> Regular season record against other teams. These rules are loosly based on the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/standings/tiebreakingprocedures">NFL tie breaker rules</a>.</li>
      <li><b>GPS</b> - As of 2006, USGA Decision <a href="http://www.usga.org/playing/rules/changes_rules.html">14-3/0.5</a>  <i>"allows a Committee to permit the use of distance-measuring devices by Local Rule."</i> As of 2008, the West Blue Golf League has adopted
    the use of GPS by its players. If asked, it's requested that players who choose to use GPS, offer distance checks to players who are in the general vicinity of the player using GPS. In addition, the use of GPS can not slow down play in any manor.</li>
